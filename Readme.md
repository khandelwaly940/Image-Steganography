# Image Steganography Desktop Application

Welcome to the Image Steganography Desktop Application! This project allows you to securely hide and retrieve secret messages within images.

## Overview

This desktop application leverages advanced image processing and cryptography techniques to provide a robust solution for steganography. With an intuitive interface, users can easily encode and decode messages within images, ensuring secure communication.

## Features

- **Hide Messages:** Embed secret messages within images without compromising the image quality.
- **Retrieve Messages:** Extract hidden messages from images with ease.
- **Encryption & Decryption:** Secure your messages with strong encryption techniques.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy operation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Pillow:** A powerful library for image processing.
- **Cryptography:** A library for secure encryption and decryption of messages.
